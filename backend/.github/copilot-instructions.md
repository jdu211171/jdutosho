Modification Scope: Modify only the parts of the code directly related to the request.

Preservation: Preserve all formatting and original names, and retain comments, annotations, and documentation verbatim unless explicitly requested otherwise.

Error Handling: After making modifications, check for TypeScript errors and fix any issues before finalizing the code output. Additional error-checking steps are not required.

Output Format: If modifications are applied, output the complete code (not just a diff) so I can easily copy and paste it.
